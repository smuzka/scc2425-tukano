    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to understand how services available in cloud computing platforms can be used for creating applications that are scalable, fast, and highly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will consist in porting an existing web application to the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform. To that end, the centralized solution that is provided will need to be modified to leverage the Azure PaaS portfolio, in ways that agree with current cloud computing engineering best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the end result, besides the implementation code, a final report will need to explain the design choices and provide a performance evaluation of the solution, for at least two deployment scenarios. One scenario will match a web application with high popularity at a regional (continental) scale; the other targets a global scale, where the application will have users/clients spanning across multiple continents."

TuKano users can upload short videos to be viewed (and liked) by other users of the plataform.

The returned *metadata* contains the URL where the short video media needs to be uploaded to. This URL points to the upload endpoint in **Blobs** service and includes a **token** to ensure the safety of the upload procedure. Namely, the upload operation needs to match a short that has been created through the proper endpoint and the upload must occur within the allowed time limit.\n",
